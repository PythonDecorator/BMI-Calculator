## Overview

BMI Calculator is a user-friendly desktop application.

The purpose of this project is to create a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that helps users assess their health by
calculating their BMI based on their weight and height. "BMI Calculator" offers a simple and effective way for users to
monitor their health and make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices.

## Demo

![demo-blog.gif](apps/static/assets/demo/demo-blog.gif)

- **Download the One file .exe file from the dist or download folder**
- **You don't need to install anything, just download, click and start playing.**

<br />

## Features

>  Hers are some main features

1. ✅ `Friendly Interface`: An intuitive and visually appealing interface that guides users through the process
   of inputting their weight and height.

2. ✅ `BMI Calculation`: Implemented the BMI formula to accurately calculate the user's Body Mass Index using their
   weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).

3. ✅ `Result Display`: Displays the calculated BMI value along with an associated interpretation, indicating whether the
   user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

4. ✅ `Metric and Imperial Units`: Allow users to choose between metric (kilograms and meters) and imperial (pounds and
   inches) units for inputting weight and height.

## Documentation

This app was built based on the customtkinter documentation

## Converting to Executable

PyInstaller is a popular tool that allows you to convert Python scripts into standalone executable files for various
platforms, effectively creating desktop applications.

- You can use PyInstaller options to customize the behavior and appearance of the generated executable. Refer to the
  PyInstaller documentation for more information on available options.
- Keep in mind that PyInstaller generates a self-contained executable, but the size of the executable might be larger
  due
  to the inclusion of the Python interpreter and any dependencies, it's best to use venv to make sure only packages used
  in the
  project are included.
- Be sure to test the generated executable on the
  target platform to ensure everything works as expected.

<br />

> Install modules via `VENV`

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Create the .exe file

```bash
$ pyinstaller main.spec 
```
